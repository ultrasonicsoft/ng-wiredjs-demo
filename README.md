# Wireframe/Sketched Angular (v8) application

Are you tired of building typical Material Design/Bootstrap and other design system websites and wants to build something sketchy for fun? If yes, then let's build one!

## [WiredJS Library](https://github.com/wiredjs/wired-elements)
WiredJS is a web component library which offers sketchy hand-drawn like web components. Don't forget to checkout their showcase of web components.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
